# AI Conspiracy Generator

An AI-powered comedy platform where one AI agent creates increasingly ridiculous conspiracy theories while another AI agent investigates, fact-checks, and debunks them.

> **The goal is not to promote misinformation.**
>
> The goal is to demonstrate how easily narratives can be constructed around incomplete information while using humor, critical thinking, and adversarial AI reasoning to separate fact from fiction.

---

# Overview

AI Conspiracy Generator is a multi-agent AI system that turns ordinary events into absurd conspiracy theories and then systematically dismantles them.

Users provide a simple event:

> Why did the neighborhood power go out?

One AI agent creates increasingly elaborate theories.

Another AI agent investigates the evidence.

A third agent may score the theories for creativity, plausibility, and comedy.

The result is a humorous demonstration of how narratives, assumptions, and speculation can quickly diverge from reality.

# Why This Project Exists

Humans are naturally wired to seek patterns and explanations.

Given limited information, it is surprisingly easy to construct convincing stories that appear logical but have little connection to reality.

AI Conspiracy Generator uses humor to illustrate:

- Confirmation bias
- Narrative construction
- Critical thinking
- Evidence evaluation
- Fact checking
- Adversarial reasoning

The platform is designed as entertainment first and educational second.

---

# Core Concept

Input:

```text
Why did the neighborhood power go out?
```

---

## Theory Agent

Creates a conspiracy theory.

```text
The outage coincided with a full moon,
three missing cats, and a delivery truck
from an unknown company.

This strongly suggests an underground
squirrel organization is testing
electromagnetic acorn technology.
```

---

## Investigator Agent

Examines the evidence.

```text
Utility company records show
a contractor accidentally struck
a transformer with a backhoe
at 2:17 PM.

No evidence of electromagnetic
acorns was discovered.
```

---

## Judge Agent

Scores the theory.

```text
Creativity: 10/10

Plausibility: 0/10

Evidence: 0/10

Comedy: 10/10
```

---

# Key Features

## Multi-Agent AI System

Multiple AI agents with competing objectives.

### Theory Agent

Responsible for:

- Creating theories
- Connecting unrelated events
- Escalating absurdity
- Defending its claims

---

### Investigator Agent

Responsible for:

- Fact checking
- Evidence review
- Logical analysis
- Debunking claims

---

### Judge Agent

Responsible for scoring:

- Creativity
- Plausibility
- Evidence quality
- Entertainment value

---

### Evidence Agent (Optional)

Responsible for:

- Gathering facts
- Finding contradictions

- Supporting investigations

---

# Game Modes

## Classic Conspiracy Mode

Create increasingly elaborate conspiracy theories.

---

## X-Files Mode

Every event must involve:

- Aliens
- Government coverups
- Secret facilities
- Paranormal activity

---

## Corporate Conspiracy Mode

Every event is blamed on a fictional mega-corporation.

Example:

```text
The outage was caused by
Global Acorn Dynamics Corporation
to test next-generation squirrel
communication infrastructure.
```

---

## Time Traveler Mode

All events are explained through timeline manipulation.

---

## Ancient Civilization Mode

Everything traces back to:

- Lost civilizations
- Ancient technology
- Mysterious artifacts

---

## AI Debate Mode

Theory Agent and Investigator Agent engage in multiple rounds.

Example:

### Round 1

```text
Squirrels caused the outage.
```

### Round 2

```text
The squirrels are organized.
```

### Round 3

```text
The squirrels report to an
interdimensional acorn council.
```

### Investigator

```text
The outage was caused by
equipment damage.
```

---

## Escalation Mode

Each round must become more absurd than the previous one.

The system rewards creativity while the Investigator attempts to restore reality.

---

# Reality Restored™

After the debate concludes, the platform reveals the most likely real explanation.

Example:

```text
Actual Cause

A contractor accidentally struck
a power transformer while digging.

Case Closed.
```

---

# Example Scenarios

## Power Outage

```text
Why did the power go out?
```

---

## Missing Package

```text
Why was my package delayed?
```

---

## Slow Internet

```text
Why is my internet slow?
```

---

## Traffic Jam

```text
Why was traffic stopped?
```

---

## Broken Coffee Machine

```text
Why did the office coffee machine stop working?
```

---

# Educational Goals

Although designed as comedy, the platform demonstrates:

- Confirmation bias
- Logical fallacies
- Correlation vs causation
- Evidence evaluation
- Critical thinking
- Fact verification

The project encourages users to question assumptions and examine evidence.

---

# Setup

## Prerequisites

- **Docker & Docker Compose** (recommended) — for running the full stack with one command
- **Node.js 20+** — for local frontend development
- **Python 3.12+** — for local backend development
- **PostgreSQL 16** and **Redis 7** — required when running the backend outside Docker

---

## Quick Start (Docker Compose)

The fastest way to run the entire platform:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/JW2WW/AI-Conspiracy-Generator.git
cd AI-Conspiracy-Generator

# Copy environment config (mock mode works without API keys)
cp .env.example .env

# Build and start all services
docker compose up --build
```

Once running:

| Service | URL |
|---------|-----|
| Frontend | http://localhost:5173 |
| API | http://localhost:8000 |
| API Docs (Swagger) | http://localhost:8000/docs |

Enter an event (e.g. *"Why did the neighborhood power go out?"*), pick a game mode, and click **Generate Conspiracy**.

To stop:

```bash
docker compose down
```

---

## Configuration

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and adjust as needed:

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `LLM_PROVIDER` | `mock` | LLM backend: `mock`, `openrouter`, `openai`, or `anthropic` |
| `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` | — | Required when `LLM_PROVIDER=openrouter` |
| `OPENROUTER_MODEL` | `openrouter/free` | OpenRouter model ID or free-model router |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | — | Required when `LLM_PROVIDER=openai` |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | — | Required when `LLM_PROVIDER=anthropic` |
| `DATABASE_URL` | `postgresql+asyncpg://conspiracy:conspiracy@localhost:5432/conspiracy` | PostgreSQL connection string |
| `REDIS_URL` | `redis://localhost:6379/0` | Redis connection string |
| `POSTGRES_USER` | `conspiracy` | PostgreSQL user (Docker only) |
| `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` | `conspiracy` | PostgreSQL password (Docker only) |
| `POSTGRES_DB` | `conspiracy` | PostgreSQL database name (Docker only) |

**Mock mode** works out of the box with no API keys — it uses template-based responses for demo and development.

### Free models with OpenRouter

[OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/) offers API access to a changing pool of free models. Create an API key, then set:

```dotenv
LLM_PROVIDER=openrouter
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your-key-here
OPENROUTER_MODEL=openrouter/free
```

`openrouter/free` automatically selects an available free model. To pin a model, use an ID from the [OpenRouter model catalog](https://openrouter.ai/models) whose name ends in `:free`.

Free access is rate-limited and model availability can change. A one-round generation makes five model requests (evidence, theory, investigation, judging, and reality restoration), with two more requests for each additional round. The default free-account allowance therefore supports approximately ten one-round generations per day.

For direct OpenAI or Anthropic access, set `LLM_PROVIDER=openai` or `anthropic` and provide the corresponding API key.

---

## Local Development

### Backend

```bash
cd backend

# Create virtual environment and install dependencies
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate   # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Start PostgreSQL and Redis (compose file is in the repository root)
docker compose -f ../docker-compose.yml up postgres redis -d

# Run the API server
export DATABASE_URL=postgresql+asyncpg://conspiracy:conspiracy@localhost:5432/conspiracy
export REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379/0
export LLM_PROVIDER=mock
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

API available at http://localhost:8000 — interactive docs at http://localhost:8000/docs.

### Frontend

```bash
cd frontend

npm install
npm run dev
```

Dev server runs at http://localhost:5173 and proxies `/api` requests to the backend on port 8000.

### Production build (frontend only)

```bash
cd frontend
npm run build
npm run preview
```

---

# Testing

## Backend tests

```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
pytest tests/ -v
```

Tests use:
- `pytest` and `pytest-asyncio` for async test support
- `fakeredis` to mock Redis without a running server
- The `MockProvider` which works without any API keys

### Writing tests

Tests are located in `backend/tests/` and follow these conventions:

- `test_llm.py` — tests for LLM providers and score parsing
- `test_agents.py` — tests for individual agent classes
- `test_orchestrator.py` — tests for the full orchestration pipeline
- `conftest.py` — shared fixtures (Redis mocking)

## Frontend linting

```bash
cd frontend
npm run lint       # ESLint
npm run format     # Prettier
```

---

# Linting & Formatting

## Backend (Python)

This project uses [ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) for both linting and formatting:

```bash
cd backend
ruff check .       # Lint
ruff format .      # Format
```

Configuration is in `backend/pyproject.toml`.

## Frontend (TypeScript/React)

This project uses ESLint + Prettier:

```bash
cd frontend
npm run lint       # ESLint
npm run format     # Prettier
```

## Pre-commit hooks

Install pre-commit to automatically lint/format on every commit:

```bash
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install
```

Configuration is in `.pre-commit-config.yaml`.

## CI

Every push and pull request to `main` is checked via GitHub Actions (see `.github/workflows/ci.yml`):

- Backend lint (`ruff check`)
- Backend tests (`pytest`)
- Frontend lint (`eslint`)
- Frontend formatting (`prettier --check`)
- Frontend build (`tsc && vite build`)
- Docker build (`docker compose build`)

# Troubleshooting

## Docker port conflicts

If ports 5432, 6379, 8000, or 5173 are already in use:

```bash
# Stop conflicting services
docker compose down

# Or change the host port mapping in docker-compose.yml, e.g.:
#   ports:
#     - "8001:8000"   # maps host 8001 to container 8000
```

## Redis connection errors

Ensure Redis is running. If running the backend locally:

```bash
docker compose up redis -d
export REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379/0
```

## Backend won't start — database error

Make sure PostgreSQL is running and the `conspiracy` database exists:

```bash
docker compose up postgres -d
```

## Tests fail with "cannot connect to Redis"

Tests use `fakeredis` (an in-memory Redis simulator), so no running Redis is needed. If you see this error, ensure `fakeredis` is installed:

```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Frontend shows blank page / API errors

The frontend dev server proxies `/api` requests to `http://localhost:8000`. Make sure the backend is running on port 8000. For production Docker, check `docker compose logs backend` for errors.
